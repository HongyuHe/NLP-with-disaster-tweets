\autoref{fig:results-table} is a tabulated summary of the results from the models (as described in the experimental section) with the following; Accuracy of the model, Cross-Validation MSE and its standard deviation, the sum of the evaluation and training time and the section where this is discussed.

After evaluating all these models, we decided to explore the random forest further. Despite the NLP producing satisfactory results, the time to finish is prohibitive.
